Social and ethical issues, including the use or capabilities of AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability. Policies we adopt or choose not to adopt on social and ethical issues, especially regarding the use of our products, may be unpopular with some of our employees or with our customers or potential customers, and have in the past impacted and may in the future impact our ability to attract or retain employees and customers. Our decisions about whether to conduct business with potential customers, or whether to continue or expand business with existing customers, may also impact our ability to attract or retain employees and customers, and could result in negative publicity or reputational harm. Further, actions taken by our customers and employees, including through the use or misuse of our products or new technologies for illegal activities or improper information sharing, may result in reputational harm or possible liability, particularly in light of regulatory requirements like the Digital Services Act (“DSA”) from the EU. For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties. Although we believe that we have a strong defense against these allegations, legal proceedings can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations and the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Regardless of outcome, these types of claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. We are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings, including generative and agentic AI. As with many innovations, AI offerings, such as Agentforce, and our Salesforce Platform present additional risks and challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business. For example, the development of our AI offerings and the Salesforce Platform, which provides information regarding our customers’ customers, present emerging ethical issues. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability, especially as geopolitical turmoil creates increasingly volatile political and market conditions. Inadequate or ineffective AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance by us or others that result in controversy could also impair the acceptance of AI solutions or result in unintended performance of the services. This in turn could undermine confidence in the decisions, predictions, analysis or other content that our AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability and brand or reputational harm. The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact. Uncertainty around new and emerging AI applications such as generative AI content creation and AI agents will require additional investment in compliance, governance and the licensing or development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models and systems to test for accuracy, bias and other variables, which are often complex, may be costly and could impact our profit margin. Moreover, the move from AI content classification to AI content generation through our development of Agentforce and other generative AI products brings additional risks and responsibility. Known risks of generative AI currently include risks related to accuracy, bias, toxicity, privacy and security and data provenance. For example, AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed, or contains copyrighted or other protected material, and if our customers or others use this flawed or protected content to their detriment, or the owners of such copyrighted material seek to enforce their rights, we may be exposed to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm and/or legal liability. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems. If we are unable to mitigate these risks, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed. The evolving landscape related to ESG matters may expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance. Equality and sustainability are core values of the Company. In furtherance of these values, we have in the past and may in the future establish and disclose quantitative and qualitative statements related to ESG matters, which are aspirational and subject to numerous risks and dependencies. The proliferation of regulations addressing climate, human capital and other ESG topics at the regional, state, national and international levels has required and may continue to require significant effort and resources, and our practices, processes and controls may not ensure compliance with evolving standards. Further, various regulations may conflict with each other, making universal compliance challenging as a multinational company, and our status as a government contractor in various jurisdictions, including but not limited to the U.S. where we are headquartered, may also result in greater exposure or differentiated obligations or requirements with which we would seek to comply. The standards and frameworks for tracking and reporting on ESG matters continue to evolve, and our use, interpretation or application of such frameworks and standards may change from time to time or differ from those of other companies, which may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period or between Salesforce and other companies.

As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average. In addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026.

{"user_input": "How does the customer success organization impact the cost of revenues and what role does it play in maintaining subscription growth?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\n# Table of Contents integrated into our customer success organization. As of January 31, 2025, our attrition rate, excluding Slack self-service, was approximately eight percent. We continue to maintain a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. # Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow Unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Generally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter. Unearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity. # Remaining Performance Obligation Our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation. #", "<2-hop>\n\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses # Cost of Revenues Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to our employee-related costs, which includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, and allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts. Also included in the cost of subscription and support revenues are expenses incurred supporting the free user base of Slack, including third-party hosting costs and employee-related costs specific to customer experience and technical operations. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. We believe that our professional services organization facilitates the adoption of our service offerings, helps us to secure larger subscription revenue contracts and supports our customers’ success.

We focus our marketing activities in the cities and countries with the largest market opportunities.

We continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative and agentic AI across all products, which we believe will change how our customers help their customers, and continuously look to expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and expanding our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average. In addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026. We have started to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expenses.

Founded in 1999, we bring humans together with AI agents to drive customer success on one deeply unified platform. Our platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth and integrated AI, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized experiences across every channel and increase productivity. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, a new layer of our trusted platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. We continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative and agentic AI across all products, which we believe will change how our customers help their customers, and continuously look to expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and expanding our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average. In addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026. We have started to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expenses.

{"user_input": "How does the customer success organization impact the cost of revenues in relation to subscription and support services?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\n# Table of Contents integrated into our customer success organization. As of January 31, 2025, our attrition rate, excluding Slack self-service, was approximately eight percent. We continue to maintain a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. # Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow Unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Generally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter. Unearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity. # Remaining Performance Obligation Our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation. #", "<2-hop>\n\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses # Cost of Revenues Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to our employee-related costs, which includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, and allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts. Also included in the cost of subscription and support revenues are expenses incurred supporting the free user base of Slack, including third-party hosting costs and employee-related costs specific to customer experience and technical operations. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. We believe that our professional services organization facilitates the adoption of our service offerings, helps us to secure larger subscription revenue contracts and supports our customers’ success. The cost of professional services may exceed revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods. # Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our engineering staff associated with product development, as well as allocated overhead."], "reference": "The customer success organization plays a crucial role in maintaining consistent attrition rates, which is essential for sustaining growth in subscription and support revenues.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. # ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES # (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on management’s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level, that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. # (b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 based on the guidelines established in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2025. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. #", "<2-hop>\n\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. # (d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate."], "reference": "The inherent limitations on the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures include the understanding that no control system can prevent all errors and fraud. Management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, acknowledges that while their internal control over financial reporting was deemed effective as of January 31, 2025, these controls can only provide reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance, that all control objectives are met. The design of these controls must also consider resource constraints and the costs associated with implementing them. Furthermore, the effectiveness of controls can be compromised by faulty judgments, simple errors, collusion among individuals, or management override. Therefore, while management conducted an evaluation of their internal controls, they recognize that inherent limitations exist that may affect the overall reliability of financial reporting.", "synthesizer_name": "multi_hop_abstract"}

By automating simple and repetitive tasks, our support engineers will be able to augment and scale their time in a more valuable way. # Sales and Marketing We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which comprises sales personnel based in regional hubs, field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers and self-service offerings. To a lesser extent, we also utilize a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and assist in selling to prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, SIs and other partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription services. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners and developers. We focus our marketing activities in the cities and countries with the largest market opportunities. Our primary marketing activities include: - multichannel marketing campaigns that span email, social media, the web, television and more, which align to a broader customer journey; - in-person and virtual customer events of all sizes to create customer and prospect awareness, including proprietary events such as Dreamforce and our virtual Dreamforce to You, World Tours and other virtual events, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events; - live events and original programming on our Salesforce+ streaming service, which includes discussions about the future of technology in the AI-first, work anywhere world and educational content to learn new skills and pursue new career opportunities; - press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, brand, service offerings and value proposition; - partner co-marketing activities with global and regional implementation partners; - customer testimonials and our community of Trailblazers: individuals who drive innovation, grow their careers and transform their businesses using the Salesforce Platform; - in-person and virtual technology event sponsorships; and - event partnerships with high-profile global brands and organizations. # Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community.

Any violation of, non-compliance with or failure to meet such expectations or requirements, or negative publicity related to our ESG practices or disclosures, could result in harm to our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner, acquiror or service provider, could expose us to increased scrutiny or criticism or to regulatory or enforcement actions or litigation, and could cause us to incur increased costs to address or defend against such actions. #", "<2-hop>\n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Privacy concerns and laws as well as evolving regulation of cloud computing, AI services, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. Regulation related to the provision of services over the Internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data sovereignty and the collection, processing, storage, hosting, transfer and use of data, generally. In some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), impose obligations directly on us as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. In addition, domestic data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”), and laws that have recently passed and/or gone into effect in many other states similarly impose new obligations on us and many of our customers, potentially as both a covered business and service provider. These laws continue to evolve, including, for example, India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023, and as various jurisdictions introduce similar proposals, which often include subsequent rules and regulation, we and our customers become subject to additional regulatory burdens. New EU laws, including the DSA, the Data Act and the AI Act, may impose additional rules and restrictions on the use of our products and services. In addition, various safe harbors have historically been provided to those who hosted content provided by others, such as safe harbors from monetary damages for copyright infringement arising from copyrighted content provided by customers and others and for defamation and other torts arising from information provided by customers and others. There is an increasing demand for repealing or limiting these safe harbors by either judicial decision or legislation, and we have active legal proceedings that have been impacted by the repeal or limiting of safe harbors that were previously available to us. Loss of these safe harbors may require altering or limiting some of our services or may require additional contractual terms to avoid liabilities for our customers’ misconduct. Although we monitor the regulatory, judicial and legislative environment and have invested in addressing these developments, these laws may require us to make additional changes to our practices and services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through new or higher potential penalties for noncompliance, including as a result of penalties, fines and lawsuits related to data breaches. Furthermore, privacy laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements are causing increased scrutiny among customers, particularly in the public sector and highly regulated industries, and may be perceived differently from customer to customer. These developments could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers’ ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. For example, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, one of the mechanisms that allowed companies, including us, to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to the United States. Even though the CJEU decision upheld the Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) as an adequate transfer mechanism, the decision created uncertainty around the validity of all EU-to-U.S. data transfers. While the EU and U.S. governments have since adopted the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to foster EU-to-U.S. data transfers and address the concerns raised in the aforementioned CJEU decision, it is uncertain whether this framework will be overturned in court like the previous two EU-U.S. bilateral cross-border transfer frameworks. As a result, regulators may continue to be inclined to interpret the CJEU’s decision, and the logic behind it, as significantly restricting certain cross-border transfers and the cost and complexity of providing our services in certain markets may increase. Certain countries outside of the EEA have also passed or are considering passing laws requiring varying degrees of local data residency. By way of further example, statutory damages available through a private right of action for certain data breaches under the CCPA, may increase our and our customers’ potential liability and the demands our customers place on us. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from our commitments to customers and our customers’ customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, in particular where customers request specific warranties and unlimited indemnity for noncompliance with privacy laws, any of which could harm our business."], "reference": "The potential legal and regulatory risks associated with non-compliance in ESG practices include harm to a company's reputation, increased scrutiny or criticism, and exposure to regulatory or enforcement actions or litigation.

We continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative and agentic AI across all products, which we believe will change how our customers help their customers, and continuously look to expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and expanding our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average. In addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026. We have started to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expenses. Over the long term, we expect to see additional operating expense improvements, which could include various restructuring initiatives or measured hiring initiatives to drive operational efficiencies. #"], "reference": "Salesforce's commitment to customer relationship management (CRM) is evident in its unified platform that connects customer data across various systems, applications, and devices, creating a complete view of customers.

Agentforce can resolve customer issues swiftly and accurately because answers are grounded in our trusted unstructured content unified in Data Cloud. By automating simple and repetitive tasks, our support engineers will be able to augment and scale their time in a more valuable way. # Sales and Marketing We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which comprises sales personnel based in regional hubs, field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers and self-service offerings. To a lesser extent, we also utilize a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and assist in selling to prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, SIs and other partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription services. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners and developers. We focus our marketing activities in the cities and countries with the largest market opportunities. Our primary marketing activities include: - multichannel marketing campaigns that span email, social media, the web, television and more, which align to a broader customer journey; - in-person and virtual customer events of all sizes to create customer and prospect awareness, including proprietary events such as Dreamforce and our virtual Dreamforce to You, World Tours and other virtual events, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events; - live events and original programming on our Salesforce+ streaming service, which includes discussions about the future of technology in the AI-first, work anywhere world and educational content to learn new skills and pursue new career opportunities; - press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, brand, service offerings and value proposition; - partner co-marketing activities with global and regional implementation partners; - customer testimonials and our community of Trailblazers: individuals who drive innovation, grow their careers and transform their businesses using the Salesforce Platform; - in-person and virtual technology event sponsorships; and - event partnerships with high-profile global brands and organizations. # Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally should be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms. #", "<2-hop>\n\nHuman Capital Management Salesforce is committed to a core set of values: trust, customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability.

There were no impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2025 and 2024. # Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves.

Agentforce can resolve customer issues swiftly and accurately because answers are grounded in our trusted unstructured content unified in Data Cloud. By automating simple and repetitive tasks, our support engineers will be able to augment and scale their time in a more valuable way. # Sales and Marketing We sell our services primarily through our direct sales force, which comprises sales personnel based in regional hubs, field sales personnel based in territories close to their customers and self-service offerings. To a lesser extent, we also utilize a network of partners who refer sales leads to us and assist in selling to prospects. This network includes global consulting firms, SIs and other partners. In return, we typically pay these partners a fee based on the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer. We continue to invest in developing additional distribution channels for our subscription services. We use a variety of marketing programs across traditional and social channels to target our prospective and current customers, partners and developers. We focus our marketing activities in the cities and countries with the largest market opportunities. Our primary marketing activities include: - multichannel marketing campaigns that span email, social media, the web, television and more, which align to a broader customer journey; - in-person and virtual customer events of all sizes to create customer and prospect awareness, including proprietary events such as Dreamforce and our virtual Dreamforce to You, World Tours and other virtual events, as well as participation in trade shows and industry events; - live events and original programming on our Salesforce+ streaming service, which includes discussions about the future of technology in the AI-first, work anywhere world and educational content to learn new skills and pursue new career opportunities; - press and industry analyst relations to garner third-party validation and generate positive coverage for our company, brand, service offerings and value proposition; - partner co-marketing activities with global and regional implementation partners; - customer testimonials and our community of Trailblazers: individuals who drive innovation, grow their careers and transform their businesses using the Salesforce Platform; - in-person and virtual technology event sponsorships; and - event partnerships with high-profile global brands and organizations. # Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brands. We also enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties and control access to software, services, documentation and other proprietary information. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our service offerings. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products or services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting open source software or attracting and enabling our external development community.

Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. The above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed. As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, and specific industries, such as financial services and healthcare and life sciences, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In these market segments, the customer’s decision to use our services is often an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, may require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as addressing concerns regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations of prospective customers with international operations or whose own customers operate internationally. In addition, larger customers and governmental entities often demand more configuration, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities often require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.

{"user_input": "How does the customer success organization impact the cost of revenues in relation to subscription services?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\n# Table of Contents integrated into our customer success organization. As of January 31, 2025, our attrition rate, excluding Slack self-service, was approximately eight percent. We continue to maintain a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. # Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow Unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Generally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter. Unearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity. # Remaining Performance Obligation Our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation. #", "<2-hop>\n\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses # Cost of Revenues Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to our employee-related costs, which includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, and allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts.

The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment. # Amortization of Capitalized Costs Amortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2025 and 2024. # Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. # Marketable Securities The Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of investment income within other income on the consolidated statements of operations. # Strategic Investments The Company holds strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities and publicly held equity securities in which the Company does not have a controlling interest. Privately held equity securities where the Company lacks a controlling financial interest but does exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Privately held equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted only for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment events (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Other privately held investments not classified as debt or equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for impairment events, with any associated gains and losses recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. The Company assesses its privately held strategic investments quarterly for impairment. The Company’s impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered impaired, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment and recognizes any resulting impairment through the consolidated statements of operations.

Founded in 1999, we bring humans together with AI agents to drive customer success on one deeply unified platform. Our platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth and integrated AI, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized experiences across every channel and increase productivity. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, a new layer of our trusted platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. We continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative and agentic AI across all products, which we believe will change how our customers help their customers, and continuously look to expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and expanding our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average. In addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026.

The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment. # Amortization of Capitalized Costs Amortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2025 and 2024. # Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. # Marketable Securities The Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of investment income within other income on the consolidated statements of operations. # Strategic Investments The Company holds strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities and publicly held equity securities in which the Company does not have a controlling interest. Privately held equity securities where the Company lacks a controlling financial interest but does exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Privately held equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted only for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment events (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Other privately held investments not classified as debt or equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for impairment events, with any associated gains and losses recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. The Company assesses its privately held strategic investments quarterly for impairment. The Company’s impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash.

As such, we have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, the target of cybersecurity threats and other efforts to breach or compromise our services and underlying infrastructure. With trust as our foremost value and the foundation of everything we do, we recognize the importance of maintaining the safety and security of our systems and data. Management is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Company’s cybersecurity policies, processes, practices and risk management. The Board, including through its dedicated Cybersecurity and Privacy committee (the “Committee”), oversees the various cybersecurity risks facing the Company and the Company’s efforts to mitigate those risks. During the last fiscal year, we did not identify any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that materially affected the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. However, we face ongoing and increasing cybersecurity risks, including from bad actors that are becoming more sophisticated and effective over time, as well as a result of potential defects or disruptions in our or our customers’ services. If realized, these risks are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company. Additional information on the cybersecurity risks we face is discussed in Part I, Items 1A-C, “Risk Factors.” # Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy When a company purchases our service offerings, they gain a trusted digital advisor who will work together with them in their efforts to protect their data. We aim to provide a secure and compliant enterprise cloud platform and we work to build trust and in-depth defense into all of our systems. Among other things, we employ an experienced team of cybersecurity professionals, engage in community events and offer free online cybersecurity incident prevention training to help enable our customers to focus on their business, knowing their data is safe and accessible as needed. We seek to address material cybersecurity risks through a company-wide approach that assesses, ranks and prioritizes cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities and issues as they are identified to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information systems and the information that we collect and store. The Company’s cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices are informed by recognized frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the International Organization for Standardization and an array of other applicable standards-setting bodies, which are integrated into a broader risk management framework and related processes. We also hold various security-related industry certifications and attestations that have been validated by external auditors, including SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3, ISO 27001, 27017 and 27018, CSA STAR and others. Leveraging threat intelligence and other signals, the Company undergoes periodic testing, audits and reviews of its policies, standards, processes and practices to identify, assess and address cybersecurity risks and events. The Company also undergoes routine internal and external penetration testing. The results of such tests and assessments are evaluated by management and periodically reported to the Committee. The Company further adjusts its cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices based on these results and evolving industry practices. The Company also publishes attestations of its various certifications, audits, and penetration tests on its global compliance webpage. #", "<2-hop>\n\nBoard Oversight and Governance As mentioned above, the Board established the Committee to provide dedicated oversight of cybersecurity-related management, strategy, initiatives, risks, threats and remediation activities. The Committee receives regular presentations, reports and updates from the Company’s Chief Trust Officer (“CTrO”) and other members of management on developments regarding the Company’s cybersecurity program, broader cybersecurity trends, evolving industry standards, the threat environment and other topics. After each quarterly meeting of the Committee, the Board receives a report from the Chair of the Committee with an update on the Company’s oversight of cybersecurity risks and mitigation efforts. The Committee also receives periodic reports from an experienced outside consultant with information security expertise providing insights on key focus areas to aid in the Committee’s oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity program. The Company’s processes also allow for the Board and the Committee to be informed of key cybersecurity risks outside the regular reporting schedule.

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal 2025 was consistent with the same period a year ago. Our general and administrative headcount increased by three percent during fiscal 2025. We expect that general and administrative expenses may decrease as a percentage of revenues over time as we continue to invest in process efficiency initiatives, which includes the use of AI and agents.

In fiscal 2025 these factors resulted in impairments on privately-held equity and debt securities of $582 million, partially offset by $358 million in unrealized gains on privately held equity securities. Other income primarily consists of interest income on our marketable securities portfolio, which is partially offset by interest expense on our debt as well as our finance leases.

We continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative and agentic AI across all products, which we believe will change how our customers help their customers, and continuously look to expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and expanding our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average. In addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026. We have started to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expenses. Over the long term, we expect to see additional operating expense improvements, which could include various restructuring initiatives or measured hiring initiatives to drive operational efficiencies. #"], "reference": "Salesforce's management's discussion and analysis highlights several strategies aimed at enhancing customer relationship management (CRM) and driving growth in fiscal 2025.

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues during fiscal 2025 was consistent with the same period a year ago. Our general and administrative headcount increased by three percent during fiscal 2025. We expect that general and administrative expenses may decrease as a percentage of revenues over time as we continue to invest in process efficiency initiatives, which includes the use of AI and agents.

In fiscal 2025 these factors resulted in impairments on privately-held equity and debt securities of $582 million, partially offset by $358 million in unrealized gains on privately held equity securities. Other income primarily consists of interest income on our marketable securities portfolio, which is partially offset by interest expense on our debt as well as our finance leases.

The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment. # Amortization of Capitalized Costs Amortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2025 and 2024. # Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. # Marketable Securities The Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of investment income within other income on the consolidated statements of operations. # Strategic Investments The Company holds strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities and publicly held equity securities in which the Company does not have a controlling interest. Privately held equity securities where the Company lacks a controlling financial interest but does exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Privately held equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted only for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment events (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Other privately held investments not classified as debt or equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for impairment events, with any associated gains and losses recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. The Company assesses its privately held strategic investments quarterly for impairment. The Company’s impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered impaired, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment and recognizes any resulting impairment through the consolidated statements of operations.

{"user_input": "How does the customer success organization impact the cost of revenues and overall growth in subscription and support revenues?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\n# Table of Contents integrated into our customer success organization. As of January 31, 2025, our attrition rate, excluding Slack self-service, was approximately eight percent. We continue to maintain a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. # Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow Unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Generally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter. Unearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity. # Remaining Performance Obligation Our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation. #", "<2-hop>\n\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses # Cost of Revenues Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to our employee-related costs, which includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, and allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts. Also included in the cost of subscription and support revenues are expenses incurred supporting the free user base of Slack, including third-party hosting costs and employee-related costs specific to customer experience and technical operations. Cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. We believe that our professional services organization facilitates the adoption of our service offerings, helps us to secure larger subscription revenue contracts and supports our customers’ success. The cost of professional services may exceed revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods. # Research and Development Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our engineering staff associated with product development, as well as allocated overhead."], "reference": "The customer success organization plays a crucial role in maintaining consistent attrition rates, which is essential for sustaining growth in subscription and support revenues. As of January 31, 2025, the attrition rate was approximately eight percent, aided by various customer programs and initiatives that promote enterprise adoption.

{"user_input": "What are the recoverable amounts related to cash and cash equivalents and how does the Company measure fair value for its marketable securities and strategic investments?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\n# Table of Contents The capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all noncancellable customer contracts. The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment. # Amortization of Capitalized Costs Amortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2025 and 2024. # Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. # Marketable Securities The Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of investment income within other income on the consolidated statements of operations. # Strategic Investments The Company holds strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities and publicly held equity securities in which the Company does not have a controlling interest. Privately held equity securities where the Company lacks a controlling financial interest but does exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Privately held equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted only for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment events (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Other privately held investments not classified as debt or equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for impairment events, with any associated gains and losses recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. The Company assesses its privately held strategic investments quarterly for impairment. The Company’s impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered impaired, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment and recognizes any resulting impairment through the consolidated statements of operations. Publicly held equity securities are measured at fair value with changes recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. #", "<2-hop>\n\nFair Value Measurement The Company measures its cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, publicly held equity securities and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. In addition, the Company measures certain of its strategic investments, including its privately held debt and equity securities, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there has been an observable price change in a same or similar security or an impairment event.

{"user_input": "How does the customer success organization impact the cost of revenues?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\n# Table of Contents integrated into our customer success organization. As of January 31, 2025, our attrition rate, excluding Slack self-service, was approximately eight percent. We continue to maintain a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues. # Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow Unearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. Generally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter. Unearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity. # Remaining Performance Obligation Our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months. Remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation. #", "<2-hop>\n\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses # Cost of Revenues Cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to our employee-related costs, which includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, and allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts.

Founded in 1999, we bring humans together with AI agents to drive customer success on one deeply unified platform. Our platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth and integrated AI, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized experiences across every channel and increase productivity. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, a new layer of our trusted platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. We continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative and agentic AI across all products, which we believe will change how our customers help their customers, and continuously look to expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and expanding our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average. In addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026. We have started to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expenses. Over the long term, we expect to see additional operating expense improvements, which could include various restructuring initiatives or measured hiring initiatives to drive operational efficiencies. #"], "reference": "Management's discussion and analysis highlights the importance of customer relationship management (CRM) technology, as exemplified by Salesforce, which connects companies with their customers through data and AI.

{"user_input": "How does the Company determine the fair value measurement of its recoverable amounts and strategic investments, and what factors influence this assessment?", "reference_contexts": ["<1-hop>\n\n# Table of Contents The capitalized amounts are recoverable through future revenue streams under all noncancellable customer contracts. The Company periodically evaluates whether there have been any changes in its business, the market conditions in which it operates or other events which would indicate that its amortization period should be changed or if there are potential indicators of impairment. # Amortization of Capitalized Costs Amortization of capitalized costs to obtain revenue contracts is included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There were no impairments of costs to obtain revenue contracts for fiscal 2025 and 2024. # Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at fair value. # Marketable Securities The Company considers all of its marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, and therefore classifies these securities within current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with the change in unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income until realized. Fair value is determined based on quoted market rates when observable or utilizing data points that are observable, such as quoted prices, interest rates and yield curves. Securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed to determine what amount of the excess, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Expected credit losses on securities are recognized in other income on the consolidated statements of operations and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. For the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses, the cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on securities classified as available for sale is included as a component of investment income within other income on the consolidated statements of operations. # Strategic Investments The Company holds strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities and publicly held equity securities in which the Company does not have a controlling interest. Privately held equity securities where the Company lacks a controlling financial interest but does exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Privately held equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are recorded at cost and adjusted only for observable transactions for same or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment events (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on privately held equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Privately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. Other privately held investments not classified as debt or equity securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for impairment events, with any associated gains and losses recorded through losses on strategic investments, net on the consolidated statements of operations. Valuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data. In determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies, the Company utilizes the most recent data available to the Company. The Company assesses its privately held strategic investments quarterly for impairment. The Company’s impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's financial metrics, market acceptance of the investee's product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered impaired, the Company estimates the fair value of the investment and recognizes any resulting impairment through the consolidated statements of operations.

Our forward-looking statements and factors that might cause future actual results to differ materially from our recent results or those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section titled “Forward-Looking Information” and “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update the forward-looking statements or our risk factors for any reason. The following section generally discusses fiscal 2025 and 2024 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2025 and 2024, as well as certain fiscal 2023 items. Discussions of fiscal 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2024 and 2023 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. #", "<2-hop>\n\nOverview Salesforce is a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology, enabling companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers through the power of data, artificial intelligence (“AI”), CRM and trust. Founded in 1999, we bring humans together with AI agents to drive customer success on one deeply unified platform. Our platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth and integrated AI, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized experiences across every channel and increase productivity. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we introduced Agentforce, a new layer of our trusted platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. We continue to invest for growth, including investing in generative and agentic AI across all products, which we believe will change how our customers help their customers, and continuously look to expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry. We continue to focus on several key growth levers, including driving multiple service offering adoption, increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customers and expanding our industry-specific reach with more vertical software solutions. These growth levers often require a more sophisticated go-to-market approach and, as a result, we may incur additional costs upfront to obtain new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers, including additional sales and marketing expenses specific to subscription and support revenue. As a result, we have seen that customers with many of these characteristics drive higher annual revenues and have lower attrition rates than our company average. In addition to our focus on top line growth levers, we are also focused on reducing our operating expenses to improve our operating margin. For example, in January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth which included a reduction of our workforce by approximately ten percent and office space reductions within certain markets. The employee actions were substantially completed in fiscal 2024 and the real estate actions are expected to be fully complete in fiscal 2026. In addition, we continued to evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize our management structure and increase cost optimization efforts to realize long-term sustainable growth, including targeted workforce and office space reductions that were initiated in fiscal 2025 and are expected to be substantially complete in fiscal 2026. We have started to see improvements in our operating expenses across all operating categories, with the most opportunity in sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expenses. Over the long term, we expect to see additional operating expense improvements, which could include various restructuring initiatives or measured hiring initiatives to drive operational efficiencies. #"], "reference": "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition highlights the company's expectations regarding future revenues and expenses, which are crucial for understanding the financial health of Salesforce.

In connection with any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Participant agrees to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax Obligations. In this regard, Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations or rights with regard to all Tax Obligations, if any, by withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired at exercise of the Option either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on Participant’s behalf pursuant to this authorization) without further consent. Alternatively, the Company, or the Employer, or their respective agents, in their sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, may satisfy their withholding obligations or rights with regard to all Tax Obligations, if any, in whole or in part (without limitation) by (i) requiring Participant to deliver cash or a check to the Company or the Employer, (ii) withholding from Participant’s wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the Company and/or the Employer, or (iii) reducing the number of Shares otherwise deliverable to Participant; provided, however, that if Participant is a Section 16 officer of the Company under the Exchange Act, then the Company will withhold from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired at exercise of the Option, unless the use of such withholding method is inadvisable under Applicable Laws or has materially adverse accounting consequences, in which case, the withholding obligation or right for Tax Obligations, if any, may be satisfied by one or a combination of methods (i) and (ii) above, or at the election of Participant, by method (iii). For avoidance of doubt, if Participant is a non-U.S. employee, payment of Tax Obligations may not be effectuated by surrender of other Shares with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of any Tax Obligations. Further, depending on the withholding method, the Company or the Employer may withhold or account for Tax Obligations by considering statutory or other withholding rates, including minimum or maximum rates applicable in Participant’s jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, Participant may receive a refund from the Company of any over-withheld amount in cash (with no entitlement to the equivalent in Common Stock), or if not refunded by the Company, Participant may need to seek a refund from the local tax authorities to the extent Participant wishes to recover the over-withheld amount in the form of a refund; provided, however, that where the application of maximum rates would, in the Company’s determination, result in adverse accounting consequences to the Company, the Company shall withhold only amounts sufficient to meet the minimum statutory Tax Obligations required to be withheld or remitted with respect to the Option. #", "<2-hop>\n\n(c) Notice of Disqualifying Disposition of ISO Shares.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. # ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES # (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this report. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Based on management’s evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to, and are effective to, provide assurance at a reasonable level, that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. # (b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 based on the guidelines established in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2025. We reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. #", "<2-hop>\n\n(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. # (d) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate."], "reference": "The implications of material changes in internal control over financial reporting, as discussed in the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, indicate that while management conducted an evaluation and concluded that their internal controls were effective as of January 31, 2025, there were no changes during the quarter that materially affected these controls. This suggests that the existing controls are deemed sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting. However, it is also acknowledged that inherent limitations exist within any control system, meaning that while controls are designed to mitigate risks, they cannot guarantee absolute prevention of errors or fraud.", "synthesizer_name": "multi_hop_abstract"}
