# Bio Reasoning Project


## Environment Setup

Before running any program here, we need to do basic lib imports at the toplevel of this project.

```
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

In order to run the `bioagents` module, we need to set the following env variable at the toplevel:

```
export PYTHONPATH="`pwd`"
```
