# Bio Reasoning Project

## Environmental Setup

Before running any program here, we need to do basic lib imports at the top level of this project

```
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

In order to run the bioagents module, we need to set the following env variables:

```
export PYTHONPATH="`pwd`"
```
